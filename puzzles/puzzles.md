Puzzles for group activites
===========================

The criterias for puzzles I'm looking for are:

    - suitable for group reasoning
    - attempts should be able to yield more information to help further guesses
    - possible to ask verifying questions

First out looking through "Klassisk och modern n√∂jesmatematik" by Paul Vaderlind. The best match I can find is alphametics, for example "send + more = money", see [implementation](alphametic1.py). Even though it includes reasoning to get the answer I cannot see a good way to implement it as a guessing game. And it's probably better as an individual puzzle.
