Puzzles for group activites
===========================

The criterias for puzzles I'm looking for are:

    - suitable for group reasoning
    - attempts should be able to yield more information to help further guesses
    - possible to ask verifying questions

First out looking through "Klassisk och modern n√∂jesmatematik" by Paul Vaderlind. The best match I can find is alphametics, for example "send + more = money", see [implementation](alphametic1.py). Even though it includes reasoning to get the answer I cannot see a good way to implement it as a guessing game. And it's probably better as an individual puzzle.

Next, "The Code Book" by Simon Singh. Lot's of interesting stuff here. For a simpler puzzle the early parts looking at substitution cipher looks most promising. Looking at how they evovled there's lots of nice ways of making the cipher harder to solve. Maybe not as much as a puzzle as I would like, but seems useful for group exercise. By making it into a program we can add more dimensions of discovery as well, see [implementation](program1.py).
